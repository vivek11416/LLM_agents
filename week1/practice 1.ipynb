      "Okay, so I need to figure out the core concepts related to Large Language Models (LLMs) that are based on both Neural Networks and Transformers. Hmm, where do I start? Let me think.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, the question is asking for definitions of terms behind LLMs, specifically focusing on neural networks and transformers. So, probably these terms will be more specific within the context of what's used in LLMs. I remember that large language models are trained using big datasets, so maybe data plays a role there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with the neural network aspect. Neural networks, as I kinda understand aren't just any AI; they have layered structures. So, perhaps it's about how a multilayer perceptron fits into this? Also, if LLMs use deep learning, that involves multiple layers of neurons processing information. Maybe each layer in an MLP processes different aspects or levels of the data. That could relate to understanding how context or semantics are being captured.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user mentioned \"core concepts.\" So maybe I should think about specific components like input sequences for attention mechanisms or embedding representations? How do these inputs get transformed through layers?\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, transformers and attention. Transformers seem different from standard neural networks though. They might use something called self-attention. I've heard that each layer in a transformer can process the entire sequence at once using a set of learnable parameters. So, each token in the input looks back for all relevant positions to compute its embedding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but how does this tie into LLMs? If each position is processed independently with attention across the entire sequence, maybe that's similar to convolutional neural networks where each patch processes information based on others. But probably more sophisticated because it scales with the input size.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, token-wise processing in transformers—each token has an embedding and a context vector. The context vectors are computed as a weighted sum of all tokens' embeddings through matrix multiplication with a learnable weight matrix. So that must be part of how the model learns representations for each word at every position.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it together: In LLMs, big models have their parameters (like MLPs in another sense) and then transformers handle sequence dependencies via self-attention mechanisms. That sounds familiar from what I remember about models like BERT or GPT-3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, just to make sure—MLPs are used for non-linearities and feature transformations. So maybe the neural network part of LLMs is more about the structure of the model's components rather than standard machine learning algorithms. But they still are similar because their operations have specific structures (like multi-layer perceptrons).\n",
      "\n",
      "And then transformers specifically use self-attention to capture attention over sequences, which might be a higher-level component than the typical layers in neural networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to summarize my thoughts: LLMs use multilayer perceptron layers for general tasks and transformers with self-attention mechanisms for modeling long-range dependencies. Both are essential for capturing complex language patterns.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "Large Language Models (LLMs), such as BERT or GPT-3, integrate neural networks and Transformers to enable the learning of complex language patterns. Here's a structured overview:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Neural Networks in LLMs**:\n",
      "   - **Deep Learning Structure**: LLMs employ multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) for processing sequential data, which allows them to learn hierarchical representations from sequences.\n",
      "   - **Context and Semantics**: MLPs help capture context and semantic information by transforming input sequences through layers that process different levels of the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Transformers in LLMs**:\n",
      "   - **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Transformers utilize self-attention, where each token processes others across the entire sequence via learnable weights, allowing it to model long-range dependencies.\n",
      "   - **Positional Embeddings**: Computed from embeddings of tokens and context vectors, these embed every position in the input, enhancing representational learning.\n",

      "3. **Core Concepts**:\n",
      "   - **MLPs as Neural Networks**: Process sequential data through layers that capture feature transformations and nonlinearities.\n",
